# Steps 

## Create Docker Machine 

```sh
docker-machine create \
	--driver vmwarefusion \
	--vmwarefusion-cpu-count "4" \
	--vmwarefusion-disk-size "60000" \
	--vmwarefusion-memory-size "8192" docker01
```

### Error

```
Error creating machine: Error in driver during machine creation: exit status 255
```

It is an issue with latest dockermachine: 

See https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/1315

Solution:


> @KamilKopaczyk thanks for the detailed report, there's a more updated driver that works with all our desktop hypervisors (fusion on mac, workstation on windows and linux) that is available here: https://github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-vmware (binary releases are available as well)
> We tried to include it on docker/machine but the project no longer accepts major contributions to drivers ðŸ˜¢ .
> I'll take a look at the bug anyway as I hate to see the included driver broken.

```sh
brew install go

==> Caveats
A valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command.
If $GOPATH is not specified, $HOME/go will be used by default:
  https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin
```



```sh
brew install docker-machine
brew link --overwrite docker-machine
```

Error:
```
Error creating machine: Error in driver during machine creation: Machine didn't return an IP after 120 seconds, aborting
```

Currently stuck on this issue.

# Unable to install Virtual Box

See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8087342

> There is a workaround for this. It isn't a great workaround, security-wise, but it does get you back to the behavior of macOS 10.12. Basically, you can turn off the security feature requiring user approval of Kernel Extensions.

>First, boot into Recovery Mode by rebooting and pressing and holding command-R as soon as you see the Apple logo. On my machine, I had to hold command-R for quite a while, at least 60 seconds.

>Eventually you will see a screen that gives you a couple of options, including reinstalling or running Disk Utility. If you look at the top of the screen, where the Apple menu would ordinarily be, you will see a "Utilities" drop-down menu. Click on that and select Terminal. A window will open up that allows you to type text-based terminal commands.

> You will see a "$" prompt in the terminal window. Type the following:

```
spctl kext-consent disable
```

> then press Return. You should see:
```
 Kernel Extension User Consent: DISABLED
 Please restart for changes to take effect.
``` 

>Then reboot your Mac, and you should be good. You will no longer see the notification panes telling you a Kernel Extension was blocked; they will all be automatically allowed, just as they were in macOS 10.12.

>I would recommend waiting until 10.13.1 or 10.13.2 to see if the issue gets fixed, and then undoing this fix by repeating the same steps, but typing


```
spctl kext-consent enable
```


instead.
