# Setup.py
Is the universal standard for specifying build metadata in python.





##  Get requirements.txt from setup.py
- Change content of requirements.txt to use "."
- This will invoke "pip install ."

## Get requirements_test.txt from setup.py
- Change content of requirements_text.txt to

-e .[test]
```
- `e` is editable flag
- `.[test]` tells pip to install the "test" array of dependencies in the extras_require setting of setup.py
